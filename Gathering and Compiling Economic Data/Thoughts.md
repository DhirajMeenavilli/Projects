What economic data could an economist use to actually figure out where/what should he gather to actually make a useful and economic contribution to society? How would he know what problems are even worth trying to solve, or how would he effectively follow Talebs Revolver to not even go where he doesn't know he doesn't know. 

What could that teach us about how to be better data gatherers, and what even a data gatherer would jumdge himself by to know if he is doing well or headed to a head on collision with a mine.
