# This is where I'm gonna try out weird new tools I run across in some documentation and just play around with random problems I make up to contrive a reason to use various tools.

# Recently I've been learning Fast.ai, and that's been a very interesting journey, I think i will switch off between LeetCode, and fastai things for a bit, and whatever i learn I'll summarise here, and on the leetcode days obviously I'll solve and move on to the next question.

# I've decided that first I need a framework, and a step by step guide like Kaggle, and then it makes sense to move onto specifics like FastAi etc. I've also started trying to read sometimes too, maybe summarise it on here after th reading.
