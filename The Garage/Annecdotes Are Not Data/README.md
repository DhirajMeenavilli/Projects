# Annecdotes are not Data

A project where I'm going to try and simmulate through Python people (represented by dots), as intialising at the middle, and going through life, i.e. drifting toward one end of a bell curve or another, and as time passes the drift becomes smaller and smaller. Then at every instance of time each dot connects with
some random k neighbors. Along with being random each neighbor who connects is a random distance (some multiple of sigma away), thus the probability of connecting is determined by that distance. The dot will also be attracted to the weighted average of it's connections centers, with more recent connections being 
heavier. And at the end of the simmulation we can see, probably that no individual dot is rally very good on average at being able to gather an adequate sample of connections to end up near the center. Which effectively means it's ard to say you've sampled fairly such that you are able to accurately capture
the distribution. Rather it would show if this was the case that you'd quite likely sampled many people simmilar to how you were over time which was itself shaped by random forces, and spurious connection, resulting in a biased sample and understanding of beliefs about any given topic.

This would obviously be a greatly simplified model, but illustrative.
