# Dayt 1: I can't even chart a basic graph, it makes me feel very silly. I struggled with even writing anything because I couldn't even import Seaborn. I'll struggle with it more tommorow, and if I can't I'll just use matplotlib and go super super basic, just dummy data and like a bar plot or dot plot or something.
