# Applications of Machine Learning Which May Be Helpful 

Visual recognition of expressions etc. so that neurodivergent populations can more easily understand other peoples non verbal cues.

If there was a machine that could come up with and validate/disvalidate or rank theories explicitly, it may be very helpful indeed.

Can a machine derrive from stock prices the expected sales, margins, assets, and liabilities being discounted by the market, or atleast some list of scenarios which the market is discounting.

What we effectively keep discovering are tricks, like tricks with proofs are the best, but tricks exist in every disciple and field, so like a central system which can find all the tricks to solve a given problem as it is represented by the questioner, would be incredibly useful and would allow us to use not people as stores of external information but this would allow I think people to not need to be experts in any way they could simply ask their question, learn the skill of phrasing it well and then the tricks to solve it would be given them, and then voila progress, at a rate probably hundreds of times faster than was the case 3-400 years ago.

# Hypotheses to Explore 

Learning something you have no particular intrest in can lead to learning the exact ins and outs of learning therefore allowing for a tightening up of the iterative loop.
