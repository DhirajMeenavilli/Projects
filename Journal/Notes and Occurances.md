## With Respect to the Consequences of Fat Tails in Statistical Consequences

It may be that the very infrastructure on which we model may be wrong, and that far too many normality and modelability assumptions are made, and this may present a crack that has yet to be discovered, and requires only such a tail event to occur for it to blow up on us. Though it is always possible that rather everything is fine.

If not however it may reveal to what more things are certain to be beyond our grasp at the moment, and could potentially focus efforts or just make use of data science, where such use is good.  

In addition, it may very well present oppurtunities for new investing practices, such as effectively short selling hype, the way value investors buy statistcally profitable bundles of cheap securities. Perhaps they may even reveal things about the others such as growth about value and value about growth, fragility about value and value about fragility. As well it may present oppurtunities to reconsider a host of other decisions entirely built on on flawed foundations.

It appears most RL and other neural network techniques also tend to be dependant on assumptions of normality and tending toward normality sufficient a large sample size.
