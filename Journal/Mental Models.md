# Mental Models

Hyperparameters: higher level things above the problem which have to be tuned to best interpret the data (Comp sci)

Multiple Perspectives/Cubism: People view things differently but both correctly (Art)

Dimensionality/Intersectionality: Problems don't exist on one plane they exist in at the center of some greater context i.e. multiple axis (Math)

Corruption: The warping/warpability of purported incentives when implemented in the real i.e. gaming the system (Art)

Amplification: Reciprocation can lead to amplified responses both good and bad by the other party (Physics)

Analogous Systems: Systems of similar construct often have transferrable solutions (Math)

Bayesian Thinking/Base Rates: The probability of something occurring the way you predict it to is a value between 0 and 1 given by the product of your ability to forecast x the weighted probability of similar opportunities working out in the way predicted (weighted base rate). (Statistics)

Circle of Competence: Being able to recognize an opportunity from the outside view and having an appropriate amount of experience with similar opportunities to recognize the correct weightings of those other historical opportunities and thus forming a more valuable and accurate forecast of the opportunity at hand. i.e. the lifer (Investing)

Average vs. Present: Never forget the 6' who drowned in the river that was 5' on average or the fund manager who ended up in the top 5 percentile by just never being below the 50 percentile in any given year for 15 years. (Investing)

Inversion: "Why is it that so many wall street firms hire such bright people and get such poor results." To solve the traditional approach would answering, "Who can do it and what makes these guys different?" the inverted and easier question to solve is, "What makes these guys similar and how does that lead to them not being able to do it?" (Logic)

The Map is not the Territory: The brain  can only perceive and comprehend what it can reduce to retain able bits effectively turning the world around you into a mental map therefore as all maps are inherently reductivist you have to know the limits I.e. what you can and can't say and with how much certainty. (Geography)

Horse shoes: In life when things seem to be on completely opposite ends they are rarely dissimilar to one another. i.e. the political partys seating of the french revolutionaries. The extreme royalists were not much different from the extreme republicans who sat on the opposite side politically but within spittin distance as a person. (Political Philosophy)

Incentives: The things which materially affect a persons actions and decisions. The error often committed here is the thought that the incentives held by any entity at a given time are purely or overwhelmingly monetary/economic. (Economics)

Time Sensitivity: Situations/Tasks which require a given action to occur within a certain time interval. Useful to take into consideration with things that have to occur knowing at what time intervals it must happen and at which it is most useful to occur can be a strong supplement to knowing what must happen. (Chemistry/Cooking)

The Full picture: When presented with a statistic one has to consider not only the one box where both variables align i.e. 70% of woman who had more than 3 kids and enjoys it, but rather also what percentage of women that maybe constitutes in total as well differences between the other intersections and the one being focused upon. (Stats)

Confounding Variables: Is there something else which causes things to not be as it seems? Does a car look like a good deal to you, is it possible that it's due in part to a charismatic salesman? Is a stock or fund underperforming the market is it possible that it's due to a general bad market? (Statistics)

Error Bars: When any number or stat (median, mean, variance, point estimate, range, or any other stat) is presented to account for uncertainty one has to draw a set of error bars so as to account for the potential issues that may arise if the presented base doesn't come about. Also the size of the error bars doesn't have to be symmetrical. (Stats)

Variance: How much something does or can differ from a stated value. (Stats)

Key Operating Metrics: The 5 or so things which are within your control, measurable by a quantifiable or qualifiable value/feeling, and directly pertain to  a "better" outcome. (Investing/Business)

Weights: How strongly you value an input in deciding the output. Often we tend to assume equal weights, but this is not necessarily the truth, it often is, but the rare exception where it is not can really make a difference. (Stats)

Material Reality: The understanding that since a map is just a map the difficulties and objectives which come along the charted course may not be easily anticipated or overcome able. (Philosophy)

Destination vs Journey Planning: In journey planning we ask how do we get there in an acceptable time, fashion, and systemic fragility. In destination planning we ask to where do we want to get and what are the acceptable features of the end location in where we end up. (Management)

Hamarabes Rule: Situations in which the organism which lays out a policy experiences the policy in effect as one of the organisms whom the policy effects vs situations in which they do not. (History)

Forces at equilibrium: Often for every policy or action taken, there will be forces which act to serve your intended outcome and countervailing forces acting against it, think reflexivity or feedbacks in general and such. It is important to try and ascertain which will do what and bar that have a wet of hypothesis which tou can then test by watching the event unfold. (Economics/Physics)

Framing: The way itself which someone decides to show you something, not the why, or how but what implicitly are they getting you to assume by showing you this, and what are the alternative ways of representing this thing i.e. what points are being picked out vs. what points could be picked out. (For a policy this could mean focusing on the cost as opposed to the benefit, intention, or adequacy.) (Journalism)

Reflexivity/The Self Fulfilling Prophecy: The belief that something is going to happen, causing participants to behave in such a way as to benefit from it happening, leading to it happening.(Finance)

Culture: The ideas, and philosophical beliefs which are given exaggerated values by a collective of peoples which then feeds on itself when determining the narratives, actions, and updates to beliefs and philosophies held by the collective. (Philosophy)

Updates: To basically layer on top of what is known or replace what is known with new information which better encompasses the world in which one lives. (Computer Science)

Marginal Utility: The additional total economic utility gained by the expenditure of an additional unit of cost (Econ)

Learning: The process of observation, hypothesis creation, testing, and validation (Computer Science)

Non Realized History: The mental creation of the branches which coexist with the realized outcome and their apt weightings on the tree of history. Basically not just what occurred but how likely was that to occur.  To combat survivorship bias (Probability)

Bayesian Update: Take however likely you thought things were before for both the event occurring and not occurring, and then based on observed experience update the odds of the event occurring vs. it not occurring. (Proabability)

Fragility: That which is rigid, leveraged, or overly specialized breaks when events which are unexpected and large happen. I.e  Exposure which has accelerating harm is fragile. The inverse also holds. (Philisophy)

Non-Linearity: The derivative of a function is not a constant so an additional unit of x leads to some non constant often in life greater and greater change in y. (Mathematics) 

Fat Tails: More mountains and fewer stones and boulders than would be expected under a gaussian model of the size of rocks basically. (Probability)

Volatility Spikes: In organic systems like life, business, love, etc. Things usually go moderately ok to moderately not ok with occasional spikes of things going terrible right or terribly wrong. A mix of fat tails, critical points, and non-linearity.(Philosophy)

 Expectation vs Realization: In any situation there is the expectation (median) outcome, and the potentially realized (lower bound) outcome, and you have to be comfortable with both. Like chasing being a doctor or trumpet player without considering what happens if the expectation is not realized and how that affects you. (Philosophy)

Debugging: The act of tooling through the various procedures and operations. If there are patterns which are causing improper output from out of sample data. (Programming)

Unconscious Correlations: The act of basically taking two things which have a tight correlation and making the jump that their correlation is 1. For ex. Money and Security, or love or happiness, or Legacy and Respect or manliness, or stock price and fundamentals or Brownian model of the market and the market, etc.

Quantum Perspectives of Statistics and Reality: Basically you can measure anything statistically, (and assuming your measurements are more or less right), prior to any observation the thing about to be observed (height, dice roll) is in a state of probabilistic flux (its wave function has not been collapsed thus it is all things simultaneously), but upon the moment of observation it's wave form collapses and it becomes of some category (a market outcome, a dice roll, a height, etc.) and the way that collapse happens is entirely random and the odds of which are unknowable.

Operant Conditioning: The consequences of behaviors reinforce the beliefs and act as evidence for an identity as well as induce or dissuade that behavior if the environment for it reappears. (Psychology)

Statistically Likely means Certainty: People, me included tend to confuse livelihoods and certainties, a 70% chance of success is a success, and a 30% chance of failure is failure. (Psychology)

Winds on the Mosquitos Wings: Basically a bolt on to the random walk model of the world, that if there are elements in the world which push a variable like a stock price or a Mosquito or a poll result away from being 50/50 in their directional outcome then the probability of a random walk ending you up much further away rises drastically I.e. memory in stock prices or a wind changing the odds to go north instead of South from 50/50 to 47/53 raises a probability from 3/1000 => 27/1000 (Epidimology/Probability)

Symmetry: This is simply the idea that the idea of sameness can be expanded or shrank to suit the problem you're studying so if you're just studying angles then along with rotating, sliding, and flipping, you could also say any shape which holds the angles constant including making the shape bigger or smaller are the same. In the same way you can translate any problem into another problem given it doesn't change any of the things you do need to stay in the same for ex. Area, or angles, or number of holes. (Geometry)

Shannon Information: Probabilistically speaking, a rarer term, word, or phrase carries more information then does something more common, so for example the letters Y_K carry much more information i.e. less uncertainty about what the word is than does _AK, and this basically is true in any domain be it security analysis, ML, Psych etc. (Comp Sci; Information Theory)

Private Definitions: All terms and ideas had to originate from someone, thus they are by definition private and thus a function of political, historical, economic and domain contexts, as well as the incentives and education received. Thus it must always be understood as an imperfect model of the world, and so to have any intelligent discussion one must be able to see the edges and flaws or simply say you're not knowledgeable enough to know. (Journalism/Philosophy)

Master Studies: Look to people one chapter to whole libraries ahead of you and try to recreate a particular thing that you've noticed they do, then play with it by doing at least 3 versions. This way you can get a good idea of why they did what they did and what works what doesn't it's also a safe way to build intuition. Then once you have mastery up to a certain point keep tackling the guts and rearranging things until you've mastered it, at which point look to other domains to draw inspiration from. (Art)

Divergence to Convergance: Start with many, select one which looks intersting, abandon if it gets to be nowhere and go back and dive into another. (Art)

Follow Expiriment: Never have full conclusion, only unless logic dictate something is not the case, allow expiriment and observation to dictate the direction and weight of beliefs. (Philisopohy)
