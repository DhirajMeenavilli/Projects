I Hope to make this the most disability friendly coding environment and if there's surplus cash it can be used to spur teaching programs.
Like high quality ones which let even the very disabled person pick up and understand the skills and have the ability to code and earn
and paint and do whatever else they want. (A sort of commercial extension of The Gallery.)
