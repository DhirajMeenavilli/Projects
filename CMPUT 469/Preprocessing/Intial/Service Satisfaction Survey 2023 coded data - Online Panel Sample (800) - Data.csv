I know its important that a person should be fully trained before they are given the opportunity to operate a vehicle but not when you the instructors know this person is capable but still find a reason to fail them just so they can come and pay again.

15701,1.740446,3,"Life in Edmonton was Good when I moved here in 1997 and during the 2000's it was Very Good. Unfortunately during the past decade, and particularly during the past 5 years I would say that our standard of living has been steadily declining. Local Infrastructure projects clearly show how our City is declining and falling behind on many fronts, for example having less than 3 lanes in any part of Anthony Henday particularly on its bridges was simply Abysmal planning which is now costing us a fortune to fix. Bridge building projects such as the 102 Ave bridge was yet another Fiasco that has sadly become typical in our City. Our LRT system also clearly displays how we are ineffective and obsolete compared to just about any other City. Rail Gate and Bells ""Crossings"" are reminiscent of the 1800's when the Stage-Coaches has to stop to let trains pass by, having any type of interference between rail and road traffic flow does not belong in this century! Over 100 years ago Paris or London had way superior subway systems before Alberta was even a Province ,all underground and with ZERO crossings. Naming the few LRT lines (i.e. Metro Line, Valley Line) is yet another example of POOR design and lack of logic. Stations are the only thing that should be named in a modern subway system. Naming anything else is childish and adds zero value. One need only to look at a map of the current Paris (France) metro system to see how the hundreds of stations are named however none of the lines are. Lines are simply given a number, or a colour. Naming the lines, adds nothing; exempt perhaps adds needless confusion. Wasting taxpayers money on useless projects is another reason why Edmonton is declining. Obsession with extremely expensive and non-needed bicycle lanes that remain covered in deep snow during half of the year serve only to add traffic congestion to our city.
