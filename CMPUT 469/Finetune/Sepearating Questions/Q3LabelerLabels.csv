I have tried for a month or so to get rid of some large plastic piece of garbage. It fits in the garbage, but it is still in the black bin.

Most people are homeless because they can't find a job to help support themselves leading people to become homeless.  2. Business and cooperation, (registry)  Upon a couple of experiences I have had in the last 2 months I think the registries in the city are just taking advantage of people, especially new drivers because I've been trying to get my driver's license and some of the instructors that I've had just watched make a mistake so they can have a reason to fail you. I know its important that a person should be fully trained before they are given the opportunity to operate a vehicle but not when you the instructors know this person is capable but still find a reason to fail them just so they can come and pay again. It's not fair as they are people in the country who struggle to get a job and support themselves financially.
