This is a project which I hope can help Canadians understand, communicate, and have deeper insight on the specifics of policies, laws, and people which have so come to dominate our existence.

The plan currently is as follows:
    1. Get the data from the online data tool that the govt. has
    2. Clean the data to have basically only the columns you need
    3. Fashion the data into easy to understand cards in a html or other web scripting language
    4. Add in the various senators, house and parliment members and how they voted on various things
    5. Potentially use clustering to organise bills into catergories
    6. Allow people to filter by geographic imapct, politician, and catergory of bill
    7. Possibly turn it into an app where individuials can vote on the bills they're interested in allowing themselves a voice.
    8. Group/cluster the individuals votes by geography, age, and political leaning (if sufficent data, and consent exist)
