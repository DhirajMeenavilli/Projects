# The Tricks in this sections are hashes/set which are in python just dictionaries, because you can write to them in O(1), and check an in statement on them in O(1), so it allows O(N) solutions to come about as you just do multiple passes through the hash and the other trick is sorting, which is in Python O(N log N), so usually runs up time complexity a bit but can be very useful.
